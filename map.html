        <h1>BANGALORE</h1>

        <hr>
        <div class="col-sm-8">

          <p style="font-size: 1.2em;color:black">
            The vibrant metropolis of Bangalore, also known as Bengaluru, holds the distinction of being the capital of
            Karnataka, India's third-largest city. Earning the moniker "The Garden City" for its year-round pleasant
            climate, Bangalore offers a delightful escape. Its rich history stretches back to the 9th century CE, with a
            pivotal role played by Kempegowda, a chieftain credited with founding the city in the 16th century. His
            legacy lives on in the city's layout and historical landmarks.

            <br>
            In the modern era, Bangalore has become a leading force in India's high-tech industry, aptly named the
            "Silicon Valley of India." The city attracts numerous information technology (IT) companies, aerospace and
            defense industries, and biotechnology firms, making it a bustling hub for innovation and progress.
            <br>
            Beyond its technological prowess, Bangalore offers a vibrant cultural scene. Visitors can experience
            traditional festivals, captivating music and dance performances, and a unique blend of Kannada, Telugu,
            Tamil, and Hindi influences. For history buffs, architectural marvels like the neo-Dravidian Vidhana Soudha
            and the majestic Bangalore Palace stand as testaments to the city's past. Nature lovers can find solace in
            the sprawling Cubbon Park, one of the city's largest green spaces.

        <h1>BANGALORE'S CLIMATE </h1>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em;color:black">Bangalore, aptly nicknamed "The Garden City," boasts a year-round
          climate that's both pleasant and comfortable. Unlike many Indian cities that experience scorching summers and
          harsh winters, Bangalore enjoys a more moderate temperature range. Summers, typically from March to May, are
          warm with average highs between 26°C (79°F) and 32°C (90°F). Winters, on the other hand, are mild with
          temperatures averaging between 16°C (60°F) and 24°C (75°F) from November to February. This moderate climate is
          attributed to Bangalore's elevation on the Deccan Plateau, which keeps it cooler than some surrounding areas.

      <div class="col-sm-6" style="text-align: justify; color:black">
        Bangalore's crown jewel, the Vidhana Soudha, is an architectural marvel that embodies the city's rich heritage
        and modern spirit. This neo-Dravidian masterpiece, completed in 1956, serves as the seat of the Karnataka State
        Legislature. Its imposing white granite facade, adorned with intricate carvings and towering domes, is a sight
        that leaves a lasting impression.

        Beyond its visual grandeur, the Vidhana Soudha is a testament to Indian craftsmanship. Over 5000 skilled
        laborers and artisans meticulously crafted the building, showcasing traditional techniques alongside modern
        architectural concepts. Inside, the Vidhana Soudha houses the legislative chambers and government offices, all
        designed for functionality and aesthetics.
        <br>
        <p style="color:black">Standing tall amidst sprawling gardens, the Vidhana Soudha is more than just a government
          building. It's a symbolic landmark that reflects Bangalore's evolution from a historical city to a thriving
          modern metropolis.This transformation is further echoed in the building's design. The neo-Dravidian style pays
          homage to Bangalore's historical roots, while the incorporation of modern architectural concepts symbolizes
          the city's forward-thinking spirit. The Vidhana Soudha thus serves as a bridge between Bangalore's illustrious
          past and its dynamic present.

        <div class="col-sm-6" style="text-align: justify;color:black">
          Bangalore enjoys robust road connectivity facilitated by a network of national and state highways, making it a
          pivotal hub for road travel in South India. National Highways such as NH 44, NH 75, and NH 48 play crucial
          roles in connecting Bangalore to major cities and regions. NH 44 links Bangalore with Hyderabad, Chennai,
          Kanyakumari, and Jaipur, while NH 75 connects it to Mangalore and other parts of Karnataka. NH 48 further
          enhances connectivity to Mangalore, Chennai, and Jaipur <br>
          Traveling by road from Jaipur to Bangalore is a long but scenic journey, covering roughly 1,600 kilometers and
          taking approximately 24 to 30 hours. The most common route utilizes National Highway 48 (NH48), offering
          generally good road conditions. You'll start by heading west from Jaipur towards Delhi, often using bypasses
          on NH48 or NH248 to avoid city traffic. After Delhi, continue south on NH48, passing through Gurugram
          (Gurgaon). Further down the highway, you'll encounter Kota in Rajasthan and Indore, a major city in Madhya
          Pradesh. NH48 then takes you through the western part of Maharashtra before reaching the Karnataka border. The
          journey continues through Belgaum, a prominent city in Karnataka, before finally reaching your destination,
          Bangalore. Remember, this is a general route, and depending on your specific itinerary, you might encounter
          state highways or smaller roads. Consulting a GPS navigation app or detailed maps before your trip is
          advisable for the latest road information and potential detours.
